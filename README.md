# Tensorflow-Playground
My experimentations with Tensorflow.

For now, I'm just following along to [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqLD1INA_cQ&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lak7tiFDec5_ZMItiIIfmj&index=4) by Tech With Tim on YouTube. This tutorial was build on top of [the official Tensorflow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification), which uses `keras`.

I might try to apply this new knowledge to [my TIPE project](https://github.com/Red-Rapious/Car-Computer-Vision), to try different Computer Vision techniques.
